To contribute to this project, you shall first read thoroughly all the three versions which are:  
* **[first release](https://github.com/Tanmay-901/test-case-generator/tree/master/first_release)**  
* **[second release](https://github.com/Tanmay-901/test-case-generator/tree/master/second_release)**  
* **[Final beta release](https://github.com/Tanmay-901/test-case-generator/blob/master/test_case.py)**  

And then decide in which version you want to contribute.  
Take them as more and more advanced version than the previous one in terms of:
* tkinter application  
* implementation of OOPs  
* quality of code  
* Add more legit Test case types  

However, none of them are said to be perfect,_(hence the name beta release)_, but still PRs on the later versions would be thoroughly checked and 
accepted only if they comply with the guidelines and help making the tool better.
